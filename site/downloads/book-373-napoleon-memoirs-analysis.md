## Detailed Condition Assessment

### Binding Condition: Very Good to Excellent

**Overall Assessment:** The binding is in notably superior condition to average examples of Sangorski & Sutcliffe work from this era, with exceptional preservation of gilt work being the most significant value driver.

#### Spine Condition (Critical Factor)
- **Gilt preservation:** Remarkably bright and well-preserved—the most important positive factor. Gilt shows minimal fading or rubbing, which is exceptional for work likely 100-120 years old.
- **Raised bands:** Six raised bands show clear definition with no flattening or loss
- **Napoleonic decoration:** At least three crowned "N" monograms visible, plus elaborate gilt rules, borders, and decorative fleurons
- **Green morocco labels:** "CHABOULON" author labels in contrasting green morocco represent premium decorative work beyond standard gilt-on-leather lettering
- **Leather condition:** Brown morocco leather appears supple without visible cracking, brittleness, or red rot
- **Compartmentalization:** Extensive gilt compartmentalization between all six raised bands with decorative elements
- **Date:** "1820" in gilt at spine base

**Value Impact:** The exceptional gilt preservation is the single most important condition factor and moves this set significantly up the value scale. Most leather bindings of this age show substantial gilt fading or rubbing.

#### Board and Corner Condition
- **Cloth boards:** Tan buckram cloth boards remain clean without water staining, significant fading, or soiling
- **Leather corners:** Brown morocco corners show only minimal expected wear at tips—slight rolling visible but no significant leather loss
- **Board attachment:** Boards appear to attach firmly to spine without wobbling

**Value Impact:** Minor corner wear is expected and acceptable for age. No significant detraction from value.

#### Joint Assessment
- **External joints:** No visible separation at spine/board junction—critical positive indicator
- **Structural integrity:** Books appear to sit squarely, suggesting intact interior hinges
- **Opening:** Books would require careful examination of interior hinges when fully opened, but external appearance suggests sound structure

**Value Impact:** Apparent structural soundness is essential for upper-range valuation. Weak or starting joints would reduce value 20-40%.

#### Authentication
- **Sangorski & Sutcliffe signature:** Clearly visible and properly positioned on front turn-in: "BOUND BY SANGORSKI & SUTCLIFFE, LONDON"
- **Placement:** Standard location confirms authenticity
- **Style:** Typical gilt lettering in S&S house style

**Value Impact:** Confirmed authentication is essential. Unsigned bindings or questionable attributions would reduce value by 50% or more.

### Text Block Condition

**Paper condition:** Moderate scattered foxing typical of 1820s British paper visible throughout both volumes. Brown spots are distributed but not heavy enough to obscure text or significantly impact value.

**Toning:** Pages have aged to light tan/cream color, which is universal in 200-year-old books and not considered a condition defect.

**Text legibility:** All text remains completely legible. Foxing does not interfere with reading.

**Binding security:** Pages appear firmly bound without looseness, suggesting original sewing remains intact.

**Value Impact:** The foxing is entirely normal for 1820s British books and represents typical aging patina that knowledgeable collectors expect and accept. Light to moderate foxing: 5-15% value impact. The foxing visible in these volumes falls in the "moderate" category—reducing from perfect condition value but not approaching "heavy" foxing that would impact value 20-40%.

---

## Binding Elaborateness Assessment: Upper Decorative Category

The binding exhibits more elaborate decoration than initial descriptions suggested, placing it firmly in the upper tier of Sangorski & Sutcliffe decorative work (as opposed to their jeweled bindings, which incorporate actual gemstones).

### Premium Decorative Features Identified

1. **Green morocco inlay labels** for author name—premium feature indicating higher-end commissioned work. Standard bindings would have gilt lettering directly on brown leather.

2. **Multiple crowned "N" monograms**—at least three visible on each spine, representing Napoleon's imperial crown and initial.

3. **Extensive gilt compartmentalization**—decorative ruling and borders in all six compartments created by raised bands.

4. **Decorative fleurons and tooling**—ornamental gilt tools in multiple compartments beyond basic rules.

5. **Complex color blocking**—alternating brown and green morocco sections creates sophisticated visual presentation.

6. **Date in gilt**—"1820" tooled at spine base.

7. **Raised bands with gilt rules**—traditional French-style binding with prominent spinal architecture.

### Elaborateness Classification

**Standard Decorative:** Basic gilt lettering, simple rules, minimal decoration  
**Enhanced Decorative:** Multiple gilt elements, some ornamental tooling  
**Upper Decorative:** Multiple colors of morocco, extensive tooling, thematic elements ← **THIS SET**  
**Jeweled:** Incorporates actual gemstones, miniature paintings, precious metals

The green morocco labels are particularly significant. Sangorski & Sutcliffe used contrasting colored morocco panels on their better decorative bindings. This indicates the original commission specified higher-quality work beyond their standard offerings.

## Market Analysis and Valuation

### Current Napoleon Collecting Market

The Napoleon memorabilia market remains exceptionally robust. Collectors are described as "hugely passionate" with bidding at "fever pitch" for quality items. Recent physical Napoleon artifact sales include:
- Bicorne hat: $2.1 million
- Pistols: $1.8 million  
- Diamond brooch: $4.4 million

While books occupy a more modest niche than personal effects, Napoleon memoirs in fine bindings consistently command premiums, especially firsthand accounts from the Hundred Days period.

## Historical Significance

### The Text: Chaboulon's Hundred Days Chronicle

Baron Pierre Alexandre Édouard Fleury de Chaboulon served as Napoleon's Special Secretary during the Hundred Days—the dramatic 110-day period from Napoleon's escape from Elba (March 1, 1815) through Waterloo (June 18, 1815) to his second abdication (June 22, 1815). This position gave Chaboulon direct access to:

- Private conversations with Napoleon
- Diplomatic negotiations and correspondence
- State documents and decision-making processes
- Inner circle discussions during the crisis

Published in 1820 while Napoleon still lived at Saint Helena (he died May 5, 1821), these memoirs offered immediate historical testimony from Napoleon's inner circle. The urgency and proximity to events gives Chaboulon's account particular weight—French historian Jean Tulard identifies it as "an important source for the return from Elba and the Hundred Days, especially concerning Fouché's intrigues."

The 1901 Paris edition featuring Napoleon's own marginal annotations (only 25 copies printed on Japanese paper) demonstrates the text's historical importance—Napoleon himself read and corrected Chaboulon's account while imprisoned at Saint Helena.

### The Publisher: John Murray II

John Murray II (1778-1843) was Britain's most prestigious publisher by 1820. His firm published:
- Lord Byron (Murray was Byron's friend and publisher)
- Jane Austen
- Sir Walter Scott  
- Samuel Taylor Coleridge
- Major travel narratives and scientific works

A Murray imprint signaled serious historical literature, not partisan propaganda. The firm's elegant production standards and cultural influence meant this English edition reached educated readers throughout the British Empire, establishing Chaboulon's account as a primary source that scholars still cite today.

The prestige of John Murray publication adds significant collectibility beyond the text itself—Murray imprints from this "golden age" of British publishing (1810s-1830s) command premiums.

### The Binding: Sangorski & Sutcliffe

Francis Sangorski (1875-1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878-1943) met in bookbinding classes at London County Council's Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. They founded their bindery on October 1, 1901, and within five years became known as "the most famous and fashionable bookbinders in England."

The firm revived medieval jeweled binding arts, creating sumptuous multi-colored leather bindings with real gold, precious stones, and intricate gilt tooling. Their most famous creation—"The Great Omar" Rubaiyat with over 1,050 jewels valued at £1,000—sank with the Titanic on April 15, 1912, cementing their legendary status and creating a permanent mystique around their work.

Your binding's described features (raised bands, gilt decorations, crowned "N" monograms, green morocco labels) place it in their decorative category, likely executed during their prime period of 1901-1936. The binding represents a later rebinding—since Sangorski & Sutcliffe wasn't founded until 1901, this is at minimum an 81-year-later restoration. However, rather than diminishing value, this prestigious rebinding significantly enhances the book's worth compared to original period bindings.

The firm continues today (after 1988 merger with Zaehnsdorf and 1998 revival under Shepherds Bookbinding), but early period work (1901-1936) commands the highest premiums.

## Rarity Assessment

### Edition Rarity: Moderately Rare

The 1820 John Murray edition occupies a "moderately rare" position:

- **Institutional holdings:** Scattered worldwide in major research libraries (confirmed via WorldCat)
- **Market availability:** Appears periodically on rare book dealer sites but not commonly
- **Specific combination:** No copies currently offered in Sangorski & Sutcliffe bindings found in market research
- **Digital availability:** Free digital versions available (Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive) reduce pure research value but maintain collectibility for physical copies, especially fine bindings

### Binding Rarity: Scarce

The combination of:
- 1820 first English edition
- Sangorski & Sutcliffe binding
- Napoleon subject matter
- Elaborate decoration with green morocco labels

...creates a scarce collectible. Market research found no identical examples currently offered for sale.

### Cross-Appeal Market

The set appeals to multiple collector categories, providing market stability:

1. **Napoleon collectors** seeking Hundred Days primary sources
2. **Fine binding collectors** pursuing Sangorski & Sutcliffe examples
3. **Military history enthusiasts** focusing on Napoleonic era
4. **John Murray imprint collectors** from the firm's golden age
5. **British publishing history collectors**

This cross-appeal provides multiple potential buyer categories and reduces market volatility—if Napoleon collecting softens, fine binding interest remains strong, and vice versa.

## Selling Strategy and Recommendations

### Step 1: Professional Appraisal

**Recommended appraisers:**

**Bauman Rare Books** (New York/Philadelphia/Las Vegas)  
- Actively deals in Sangorski & Sutcliffe Napoleon material  
- Would immediately recognize quality and green morocco labels
- Contact: info@baumanrarebooks.com

**James Cummins Bookseller** (New York)  
- Fine bindings specialist
- Proven track record with S&S bindings
- Contact: books@jamescumminsbookseller.com

**Raptis Rare Books** (Vermont with multiple locations)

**Request specifically:**
- "Retail replacement value" for insurance purposes  
- "Fair market value" for sale purposes
- Detailed condition description using standard terminology
- Comparables analysis

### Step 2: Photography

Professional photographs are essential for marketing. Current images are good but could be enhanced with:

1. **Spine close-ups** showing gilt brightness and green morocco labels
2. **Crowned "N" monogram details** showing Napoleonic decoration
3. **Sangorski & Sutcliffe signature** on front turn-in
4. **Representative interior pages** showing foxing level but text legibility
5. **Overall set composition** showing matching volumes
6. **Raised band details** showing gilt compartment preservation

Professional book photography services: $300-600 for complete documentation set.

### Step 3: Selling Venue Selection

**For Maximum Return: Specialized Auction**

**Bonhams**  
- Regular fine bindings and Napoleonic sales
- Achieved $75,000 for jeweled Byron Ode to Napoleon S&S binding
- London and New York locations serve international Napoleon collector market
- Expected estimate: $6,000-$9,000 with reserve at $5,000-$6,000
- Commission: 25% buyer's premium, 15-20% seller's commission
- Timeline: 3-6 months from consignment to sale

**Heritage Auctions** (Books & Manuscripts)  
- Large online bidding base increases competition
- Strong photography and marketing
- Expected estimate: $6,000-$8,000
- Commission: Similar to Bonhams
- Timeline: 2-4 months

**Christie's or Sotheby's**  
- Would likely group with other books unless part of larger Napoleon collection
- Higher buyer audience prestige
- Similar estimates and commissions to Bonhams

**Expected net after commission at auction:** $7,000-$10,000 (assuming hammer price $8,000-$12,000 less 15-20% seller commission)

**For Faster Sale: Direct Dealer Purchase**

Approach dealers specializing in fine bindings directly for outright purchase:
- **Expected offers:** $5,000-$7,000 (50-70% of retail value)
- **Advantage:** Immediate payment, no waiting for auction sale
- **Disadvantage:** Lower total return

**Middle Ground: Dealer Consignment**

List through ABAA dealer at retail price, dealer takes commission after sale:
- **Retail listing:** $10,000-$12,000
- **Your net:** 60-70% of sale price = $6,000-$8,400
- **Timeline:** 6-18 months (varies significantly)

### Recommendation

Given the $8,000-$12,000 estimated value and exceptional condition, **specialized auction through Bonhams or Heritage** offers the best balance of:
- Access to dedicated Napoleon and fine binding collectors
- Competitive bidding likely to reach upper estimate range
- Professional marketing and photography
- Credible authentication and provenance documentation
- International bidder reach

The green morocco labels and exceptional gilt preservation should drive competitive bidding above conservative estimates.

---

## Preservation and Care Guidelines

### Storage Conditions

**Temperature:** 60-70°F (15.5-21°C)  
**Humidity:** 40-55% relative humidity  
**Light:** Away from direct sunlight; use UV-filtering glass if displayed

**Avoid:**
- Basements (moisture, temperature fluctuations, flood risk)
- Attics (temperature extremes, pest access)
- Exterior walls (temperature fluctuations)
- Near water sources (pipes, appliances, windows)

### Display Recommendations

**If displaying:**
- Use bookends that support weight without pressure
- Position away from heating vents and windows
- Consider UV-filtering acrylic display case
- Rotate position every 6-12 months to prevent uneven fading

**If storing:**
- Upright position with proper support (never lying flat for extended periods)
- Acid-free archival boxes if stacking or long-term storage
- Silica gel packets to maintain humidity if climate fluctuates

### Handling Protocol

**Always:**
- Clean, dry hands (no oils, moisture, or residue)
- Support spine and covers when opening—never force books open if tight
- Open gradually to avoid stressing hinges and joints
- Use book cradles or supports for prolonged viewing
- Turn pages by top corner, never by grabbing middle of page

**Never:**
- Eat or drink near books
- Use sticky notes, paperclips, or bookmarks that indent pages
- Expose to direct sunlight or bright light for extended periods
- Force books open beyond natural opening range
- Apply any commercial leather products without professional guidance

### Leather Care

**For Sangorski & Sutcliffe morocco leather:**

**Most conservators recommend gentle dusting only** using soft brush (natural bristle, never synthetic).

**Avoid:**
- Commercial leather conditioners and dressings
- Petroleum-based products (can cause irreversible damage)
- Neat's-foot oil (can darken leather and attract mold)
- British Museum Leather Dressing (controversial among conservators)

The morocco leather used by Sangorski & Sutcliffe was high-quality and properly tanned. If properly stored at correct humidity (40-55%), leather should remain supple without intervention. If leather appears dry or brittle, **consult professional book conservator** before attempting any treatment.

### Foxing Management

The moderate foxing visible in your volumes is normal patina for 1820s British paper. It should not progress if books are stored properly:

**Prevent progression:**
- Maintain 40-55% relative humidity (prevents mold growth that causes foxing)
- Store at stable temperature
- Ensure good air circulation
- Keep books clean and dry

**Never attempt home removal of foxing.** Professional deacidification and foxing removal requires specialized equipment and expertise. Improper treatment can cause permanent damage far worse than the foxing itself.

### When to Consult a Conservator

**Immediate professional attention required if:**
- Joints start to crack or separate
- Leather becomes powdery (red rot)
- Mold growth appears
- Water damage occurs
- Pages become loose from binding
- Any structural instability develops

**Find qualified conservators through:**
- American Institute for Conservation (AIC): www.culturalheritage.org
- Guild of Book Workers: www.guildofbookworkers.org
- Local university special collections departments for referrals

## Value Enhancement and Detraction Factors

### Features That Increase Value

**Provenance (potentially significant premium):**

If you can document ownership history, value increases substantially:

- **Notable Napoleon collections:** 25-50% premium
- **Military library associations:** 20-40% premium  
- **Famous bibliophiles who commissioned S&S bindings:** 50-100% premium
- **Association with Duke of Wellington or other Napoleonic-era figures:** 100%+ premium

**Check for:**
- Bookplates (armorial, institutional, or personal)
- Inscriptions (ownership signatures, gift inscriptions)
- Auction catalog references (previous sale documentation)
- Collection marks or stamps

**Exhibition or publication history:**

If these volumes appeared in:
- Museum exhibitions of Sangorski & Sutcliffe work: 15-30% premium
- Books about fine bindings (photo publication): 10-20% premium
- University library special collections exhibitions: 10-15% premium

**Early period dating:**

Sangorski & Sutcliffe work from their prime period commands highest premiums:
- **1901-1912** (before Francis Sangorski's death): Highest premium
- **1912-1936** (Stanley Bray era): High premium
- **1936-1988** (later partnerships): Moderate premium
- **Post-1988** (modern revival): Lower premium

Some bindings include dating marks like "19S&S04" for 1904—carefully check for such marks near signature.

### Features That Decrease Value

**Condition issues (significant impact):**

- **Red rot** (powdery, deteriorating leather): -40% to -70%
- **Broken or cracked joints:** -30% to -50%
- **Severely rubbed or faded gilt:** -20% to -40%
- **Heavy foxing obscuring text:** -20% to -40%
- **Missing pages or incomplete volumes:** -60% to -80%
- **Repairs visible on spine or boards:** -15% to -30%
- **Water damage or staining:** -30% to -60%

**Later period binding:**

If this proves to be post-1936 work (after Stanley Bray era) or post-1988 revival work:
- Post-1936 but pre-1988: Reduce estimate 20-30% to $6,000-$8,000 range
- Post-1988 modern revival: Reduce estimate 40-60% to $3,000-$6,000 range

**Lack of signature:**

If Sangorski & Sutcliffe signature cannot be located, this raises authenticity questions:
- **Attribution only (style suggests S&S but unsigned):** -50% to -70%
- **Misattribution (binding by another firm):** Value reverts to standard decorative binding, approximately $2,000-$4,000

**Standard vs. elaborate decoration:**

Your binding appears to be upper-tier decorative (green morocco labels, multiple emblems). If examination reveals simpler decoration than photos suggest:
- **Basic decorative (simple gilt rules and letters only):** Reduce to $5,000-$7,000 range
- **No Napoleonic emblems or thematic decoration:** Reduce to $4,000-$6,000 range

**Incomplete set:**

Your description indicates both volumes present, which is essential:
- **Single volume only:** 30-40% of two-volume set value = $2,400-$4,800

## Conclusions and Recommendations

This two-volume set represents an exceptional convergence of historical significance, prestigious binding, and remarkable preservation. The combination of Chaboulon's firsthand Hundred Days account, John Murray's publishing prestige, and Sangorski & Sutcliffe's "Rolls Royce" binding craftsmanship creates a collectible with broad market appeal.

**The exceptional gilt preservation is the most important condition factor.** Most leather bindings of this age show substantial fading or rubbing—yours displays remarkable brightness suggesting careful storage away from light and handling throughout its 100+ year life as a rebound book.

**The green morocco labels elevate this beyond standard decorative work.** These contrasting panels indicate the original commission specified higher-quality binding work, placing this in the upper tier of S&S decorative bindings (below jeweled bindings but above standard gilt work).

**Market positioning is excellent.** At $8,000-$12,000, the set occupies a sweet spot—valuable enough to attract serious collectors, but accessible to dedicated enthusiasts rather than requiring institutional budgets. The multiple collector categories (Napoleon, fine bindings, military history, John Murray, British publishing) provide market stability.

Physical examination by a qualified rare book specialist is recommended for final authentication and condition verification.

## Important Disclaimers

### Valuation Scope and Limitations

**This report provides:** An estimated market value range based on comparative sales analysis and condition assessment from photographs. The valuation represents fair market value—the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller, both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts and neither under compulsion.

**This report does NOT provide:** A guarantee of sale price, an offer to purchase, authentication of binding or text, condition certification, or legal/tax advice. Values stated are estimates based on current market conditions and may fluctuate.

### Condition Verification Required

All condition assessments in this report are based on photograph analysis. **Physical examination is required** to verify:
- Interior hinge and joint condition when volumes are fully opened
- Complete collation of all pages in both volumes
- Presence or absence of bookplates, inscriptions, or ownership marks
- Exact dating of binding through paper stock, binding technique, and style analysis
- Detection of any repairs, restoration, or replaced elements not visible in photographs

**The valuation assumes** condition as described. Discovery of condition issues not visible in photographs (weak joints, missing pages, undisclosed repairs) would require downward value adjustment.

### Market Value vs. Other Values

**Fair Market Value** (provided in this report): $8,000-$12,000
- The price achieved in an open market between informed parties

**Insurance Replacement Value** (recommended): $12,000
- The cost to replace with comparable item at retail, including search costs and dealer markup

**Auction Estimate**: $6,000-$9,000 with $5,000-$6,000 reserve
- Pre-sale estimate range; actual hammer price may vary

**Dealer Purchase Offer**: $5,000-$7,000
- Wholesale price a dealer would pay for immediate purchase and resale

**Forced Sale Value**: $4,000-$6,000
- Price achievable in distressed or time-constrained sale

### Market Fluctuation

Book values are subject to market conditions, collector demand, and economic factors. This valuation reflects market conditions as of November 2025. Significant changes in Napoleon collecting interest, fine binding market demand, or economic conditions could affect actual realized value.

**Recommended revaluation:** Every 3-5 years or before insurance renewal, sale, or estate planning.

### Authentication

While this report identifies clear Sangorski & Sutcliffe signatures visible in photographs, final authentication should be confirmed by physical examination. If signature placement, style, or binding characteristics upon examination differ from photographic assessment, valuation would require adjustment.

### No Guarantee of Sale

This valuation provides estimated market value but does not guarantee:
- Sale at stated price range
- Sale within any specific timeframe  
- Buyer interest at stated values
- Auction house acceptance for consignment

Actual sale results depend on venue selection, marketing, timing, and individual buyer interest.

### Liability Limitation

This report is provided for informational and insurance guidance purposes. The preparer assumes no liability for:
- Decisions made based on this valuation
- Actual sale prices differing from estimates
- Condition issues not visible in photographs
- Authentication questions requiring physical examination
- Market value changes after report date
- Use of this report for purposes other than insurance and market positioning

### Professional Consultation Recommended

For significant financial decisions including:
- Sale (auction or private treaty)
