# BlueMoxon Features

**BlueMoxon** is a collection management system for antiquarian books, featuring AI-powered valuations, acquisition tracking, investment scoring, and social network visualization.

## What's New in BMX 3.0 — Social Circles

BMX 3.0 transforms BlueMoxon from a book catalog into an interactive exploration of Victorian literary culture. The centerpiece is **Social Circles** — an interactive network graph that reveals the relationships between the authors, publishers, and binders in your collection.

### Social Circles Network Graph

An interactive Cytoscape.js network visualization showing who knew whom, who published whom, and who influenced whom across the collection.

- **Node types** — Authors, publishers, and binders represented as distinct node shapes
- **Data-driven edges** — Publisher relationships (author published by publisher) and shared-publisher connections (authors sharing the same publisher) discovered automatically from book data
- **AI-discovered edges** — Family, friendship, influence, collaboration, and scandal connections discovered by Claude AI during entity profile generation
- **Era coloring** — Nodes colored by historical era: Pre-Romantic (<1789), Romantic (1789-1837), Victorian (1837-1901), Edwardian (1901-1910), Post-1910
- **Interactive filters** — Filter by era, entity type, minimum book count, and toggle binder visibility
- **Edge strength** — Connection strength (2-10) based on number of shared books or AI confidence
- **Click-to-explore** — Click any node to open its entity profile with full biographical details

### Entity Profiles

AI-generated biographical profiles for every author, publisher, and binder in the collection.

- **Bio summary** — One-paragraph biographical overview generated by Claude (Haiku model)
- **Personal stories** — Biographical facts with year, significance rating, and tone classification
- **Connection narratives** — One-sentence summaries of each entity's connections
- **Relationship stories** — Extended narratives for significant connections (cross-era bridges, hub figures)
- **Entity cross-links** — AI-generated text contains `{{entity:author:32|Robert Browning}}` markers for in-app linking
- **Portrait upload** — Upload 400x400 JPEG portraits for entities, served via CloudFront CDN

### AI-Discovered Personal Connections

The social circles graph discovers publisher and binder relationships automatically from book data. But the most compelling relationships — marriages, friendships, mentorships, and scandals — require AI.

**The Browning Problem:** Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning have books in the collection but share zero publishers. The most famous literary couple in Victorian England was invisible without AI discovery.

**Five connection types:**

| Type | Color | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Family | Blue | Elizabeth Barrett Browning & Robert Browning (marriage) |
| Friendship | Blue | Tennyson & Hallam (close friendship) |
| Influence | Blue | Wordsworth influenced Tennyson |
| Collaboration | Blue | Gilbert & Sullivan |
| Scandal | Rose | Byron & Lady Caroline Lamb |

**How it works:**

1. During entity profile generation, Claude analyzes all entities in the collection
2. AI discovers personal connections with sub-types, confidence scores, and evidence text
3. Connections are stored canonically in the `ai_connections` table (lower node ID first)
4. The social circles graph merges AI edges with data-driven edges, boosting AI connections 1.2x for sort priority

### Async Profile Generation Pipeline

Entity profiles are generated asynchronously via SQS to avoid blocking the API.

- **Batch generation** — `POST /entity/profiles/generate-all` queues all entities for profile generation
- **Job tracking** — Each batch job tracked in `profile_generation_jobs` table with progress counters
- **Individual regeneration** — `POST /entity/{type}/{id}/profile/regenerate` re-queues a single entity
- **Enqueue-before-delete safety** — New profile is enqueued to SQS before old profile is deleted, preventing data loss
- **Cancel support** — Running batch jobs can be cancelled via API

### Portrait Sync

Automatic portrait discovery from Wikidata/Wikimedia Commons for entity profiles.

- **SPARQL queries** -- Searches Wikidata for entities matching collection names
- **Scoring algorithm** -- Name similarity and candidate scoring prevents incorrect matches
- **400x400 JPEG** -- Portraits resized and uploaded to S3 via CloudFront CDN
- **Manual override** -- Admin can upload custom portraits via `PUT /entity/{type}/{id}/portrait`
- **Rate limiting** -- 1.5s interval between Wikidata requests to avoid throttling

### Entity Enrichment

Automatic metadata population for newly created entities via Bedrock Haiku.

- **Authors** -- Populates birth_year, death_year, and era classification
- **Publishers** -- Populates founded_year and description
- **Binders** -- Populates founded_year, closed_year, and full_name
- **NULL-only updates** -- Only fills in missing fields, never overwrites user-provided data
- **SQS-triggered** -- Runs asynchronously when entities are created

### Narrative Classification

The system classifies connections by narrative significance to determine content generation depth.

| Trigger | Criteria | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `cross_era_bridge` | 40+ year gap between connected entities | Generates extended relationship story |
| `social_circle` | Both entities share 2+ publishers | Generates relationship story |
| `hub_figure` | Entity has 5+ connections | Generates relationship story |
| `influence_chain` | Influence-type connection | Generates relationship story |

### Model Registry & Configuration

Administrators can configure which AI model is used for each workflow.

| Flow Key | Default Model | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `model.napoleon_analysis` | Opus | Book valuation analysis |
| `model.entity_profiles` | Haiku | Entity profile generation |
| `model.order_extraction` | Haiku | eBay order text extraction |

- **Admin UI** — Model selectors on the Config page (Models tab)
- **Database-backed** — Settings stored in `app_config` table with caching
- **Fallback chain** — Database setting > environment variable > code default
