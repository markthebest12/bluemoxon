# Session: 2026-01-31 21:00

## Issue/Task
Entity Profiles Phase 3 — planning session for gossip panel, mobile optimization, E2E tests. Then post-implementation review and issue triage.

## Current Branch
staging

## Progress
- [x] Wrote Phase 3 implementation plan (docs/plans/2026-01-31-phase3-gossip-mobile.md)
- [x] Designed 3-lane parallel worktree strategy (gossip, mobile, e2e)
- [x] Implementation completed in separate session (PRs #1591, #1592, #1593)
- [x] Post-implementation design review — 10 deviations from plan, all improvements
- [x] Full project phase audit — identified 8 undelivered items from original design
- [x] Created 5 GitHub issues from production testing:
  - #1595: "View N more" shows "coming soon" toast (blocks navigation)
  - #1596: Timeline range 1265-1967 — needs dynamic clamping
  - #1597: Zero profiles generated on production — SQS broken (CRITICAL)
  - #1598: Navigation from social circles to entity profiles
  - #1599: Add profile generation queue to health check

## Key Decisions
- This session is planning-only; implementation in separate window
- Phase 3 code is shipped but invisible on prod because #1597 (zero profiles generated)
- #1597 is critical priority — blocks visibility of all Phase 2+3 features

## Key Discovery
Production has ZERO generated entity profiles. Batch generation endpoint returns 500. SQS profile generation queue is broken/inaccessible. Health check doesn't validate this queue (#1599).

## Next Steps
1. Plan implementation for open issues (#1595-#1599) + #1590
2. Prioritize #1597 (SQS fix) as it unblocks everything
3. Execute in implementation session with parallel worktrees

## Open Questions
- Root cause of SQS 500 — env var? IAM? Queue not deployed?

### Superpowers Skills - MANDATORY
Continue using these skills at ALL stages:
- `superpowers:brainstorming` - before any implementation
- `superpowers:test-driven-development` - when writing code
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging` - when debugging
- `superpowers:writing-plans` - for multi-step tasks
- `superpowers:receiving-code-review` - for review feedback
- Context7 MCP - for library questions
- Sequential-Thinking MCP - for complex reasoning
