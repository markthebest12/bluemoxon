# Archived Documentation

Historical documentation moved here to keep `docs/` focused on active content.

## Contents

- **`plans/`** - Completed design and implementation plans (>14 days old)
- **`API.md`** - Superseded by `API_REFERENCE.md`
- **`FIX_CROSS_ACCOUNT_TERRAFORM_STATE_ACCESS.md`** - Completed fix documentation
- **`STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_PLAN.md`** - Initial staging setup (now in `OPERATIONS.md`)

## Policy

Plans are archived after ~14 days. Active designs stay in `docs/plans/`.
