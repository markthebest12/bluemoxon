## v3.0.1 - Bootstrap Release

Version 3.0.1 is the first semantically versioned release. Prior versions used
date-based tags (`vYYYY.MM.DD-<sha>`). The version number reflects the maturity
of the project at the time of the semver transition — it is not a jump from 0.1.0.

### Added

- Semantic versioning via Uplift
- PR title validation (conventional commits)
- Version display in navigation bar
- Tag-based production deploy triggers (`v*`)
