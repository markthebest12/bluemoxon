## Reference Information

### Condition Grade Standards

Use ONLY these grades (matching ABAA standards with subdivisions):
| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fine** | Near perfect, minimal signs of age |
| **VG+** | Very Good Plus - minor wear, excellent overall |
| **VG** | Very Good - some wear, all parts intact |
| **VG-** | Very Good Minus - noticeable wear but sound |
| **Good+** | Good Plus - wear evident but structurally sound |
| **Good** | Good - significant wear, complete and readable |
| **Fair** | Heavy wear, may have defects |
| **Poor** | Serious defects, incomplete, damaged |

### Binder Identification Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Only identify binders with confirmed visible signatures or stamps.**

Do NOT populate BINDER_IDENTIFIED based on:
- Style inference (e.g., "looks like Rivière work")
- Institutional provenance (e.g., "Oxford prize bindings often used X")
- Binding quality alone (e.g., "premium morocco suggests...")
- Historical probability (e.g., "Sangorski was active in this period")

**Tier 1 Binders (Premium) - SIGNATURE REQUIRED:**
- **Sangorski & Sutcliffe**: Signed in gilt on turn-in
- **Rivière & Son**: Signed on front turn-in
- **Zaehnsdorf**: Signed in gilt on turn-in
- **Cobden-Sanderson** (Doves Bindery): Signed
- **Bedford**: Signed bindings

**Tier 2 Binders (Quality) - SIGNATURE REQUIRED:**
- **Morrell**: Signed bindings
- **Root & Son**: Signed
- **Bayntun**: Signed
- **Tout**: Signed
- **Stikeman**: Signed

**Identification Rules:**
- **BINDER_IDENTIFIED**: Only set if signature/stamp is VISIBLE in images
- **BINDER_CONFIDENCE**: Must be HIGH if BINDER_IDENTIFIED is set
- If no signature visible: Set BINDER_IDENTIFIED to "UNKNOWN" and BINDER_CONFIDENCE to "NONE"
- Style observations belong in binding description, NOT in binder identification
